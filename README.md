# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project repository! In this project, we will perform an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings data for a specific city, focusing on various factors such as price, availability, location, and property type. The goal of this analysis is to identify trends and patterns in the demand for Airbnb listings within the chosen city.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to delve into the Airbnb listings data of a specific city and extract meaningful insights to understand the dynamics of the short-term rental market. By employing exploratory data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover hidden trends, relationships, and patterns that could influence the demand for Airbnb listings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To replicate and run this project locally, you need to have the following tools and libraries installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-eda.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd airbnb-eda
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required libraries:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The data used in this project comes from Airbnb listings for the chosen city. The dataset includes various attributes such as listing price, availability, location, property type, and more. The data will be used to perform the exploratory analysis and gain insights into the Airbnb market.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebook files for the exploratory analysis.
- `data/`: Holds the Airbnb listings data in CSV format.
- `results/`: This folder will contain generated visualizations and analysis outputs.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The heart of this project lies in the exploratory data analysis phase. We will use Python, Pandas, and various visualization libraries to analyze the data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Data Cleaning

Before we can analyze the data, it's essential to clean and preprocess it. We will handle missing values, format data types, and ensure the data is ready for analysis.

## Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of this project. We will create informative graphs, plots, and charts to visually represent the insights we've discovered during the analysis.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis will be performed to validate hypotheses and quantify relationships between variables. This will provide a more rigorous understanding of the data.

## Results and Findings

The results and findings of the analysis will be presented in the Jupyter Notebook. We will summarize the key insights, trends, and patterns that we've identified in the Airbnb listings data.

## Conclusion

In the conclusion section, we will provide a summary of the project's outcomes and discuss potential applications of the insights gained from the analysis.
